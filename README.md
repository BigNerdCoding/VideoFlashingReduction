# Detection of Flashing Lights in Video Content

Purveyors of media content might want to detect the amount of flashing lights in 
video content in order to inform consumers of the media in which risk of flashing 
lights occurs. This project provides a reference implementation of the algorithm 
for calculating risk of flashing lights in video content and reducing the flashing,
according to Video flashing reduction technical summary ([EPUB](https://developer.apple.com/accessibility/downloads/Video-Flashing-Reduction-12.epub)) ([PDF](https://developer.apple.com/accessibility/downloads/Video-Flashing-Reduction-12.pdf)):

- A Swift implementation of the algorithm is available in `VideoFlashingReduction_Xcode`.
- A MATLAB implementation of the algorithm is available in `VideoFlashingReduction_MATLAB`.
- A Mathematica implementation of the algorithm is available in `VideoFlashingReduction_Mathematica`.

**Important**: This sample code project includes a sample video that contains 
sequences of flashing effects.
